# Pixel to Coordinates Conversion Script

## Introduction
This Python script converts pixel locations within an image to their corresponding x and y coordinates. It demonstrates the ability to work with Python and solve a fundamental computer vision task, while also handling various image formats and edge cases.

## Prerequisites
- Python 3.x
- OpenCV library
- Pillow library

## Installation

### Option 1: Using pip
To install the required libraries, you can use pip:

##bash
```pip install opencv-python pillow```
## Running the script
```python pixel_to_coordinates.py <image_path> <x> <y> --visualize```
```<image_path>``` is the path to your image file
```<x>``` is the x-coordinate of the pixel
```<y>``` is the y-coordinate of the pixel
